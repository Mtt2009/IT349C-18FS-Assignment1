			<h1>Matthew Miracle</h1>
			
			Hey guys! My name is Matt. I have been a UC student for 3 years now, and working on a degree in Software Application Development. I gained alot of experience this past semester in my co-op, but admitedly I'll be a little rusty with some of the development tools. I chose this course for two reasons: one, because of my intrest in gamming; and two, because of my interest in development.  Gaming is what drew me to IT in the first place, and I've since gravitaed towards the technical world. 
			</br>
			As you can tell (Hovering over my picture), My favorite game is Tomb Raider. I'm pretty much into all types of games. Right now, I'm playing lots of diffrent games. To list a few:
			
			<ol>
				<li>Final Fantasy</li>
				<li>Destiny 2</li>
				<li>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
				<li>Gauntlet</li>
			</ol>
